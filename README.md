Privacy Policy for Dala App
Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Dala App ("Dala," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects the information of drivers using the Dala App ("the Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. This policy applies to drivers who use the Dala App to provide transportation services.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible via the Dala Dashboard, unless otherwise defined here.
Information Collection and Use
To provide and improve the Service, we may collect certain personally identifiable information from drivers, including but not limited to:

This information is used to facilitate the provision of transportation services, verify driver eligibility, ensure safety, and enhance the Service. The information we collect is retained by us and used as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Dala App may use third-party services that collect information to identify you or improve their services. These third parties are bound by confidentiality obligations and may not use your information for any other purpose.
Cookies
Cookies are small data files used as anonymous unique identifiers, sent to your browser or device from websites or apps you use. The Dala App does not explicitly use cookies. However, third-party code or libraries integrated into the app may use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You may accept or refuse these cookies and will be notified when a cookie is sent to your device. Refusing cookies may limit your ability to use certain features of the Service.

Ensure safety and compliance with regulations

Location data is only used within the scope necessary for the Service and is not shared beyond what is required for operational purposes.
Device Information
We may collect information about your device, such as device type, operating system, and unique identifiers, to improve the Service and prevent fraudulent activities. This information does not personally identify you.
Service Providers
We may engage third-party companies or individuals to:

Facilitate the Service
Provide the Service on our behalf
Perform Service-related tasks
Analyze how the Service is used

These third parties may have access to your personal information to perform their assigned tasks but are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Security
We are committed to protecting your personal information using commercially acceptable security measures. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Account Deletion
Drivers can delete their Dala App account exclusively through the Dala Dashboard. To delete your account, log in to the Dala Dashboard and follow the account deletion process. Once deleted, your personal information will be removed from our servers, subject to any legal or regulatory requirements.

The Dala App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18. If we discover that a person under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us to address the issue.
